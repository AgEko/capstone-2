        = Lirastrasza looks a bit let down. She agrees to 300 gold. (drunkDragon 200 gold)
        = Ending the date she flys off into the night. The town is saved! ENDGAME
    > Hit on Lirastrasza with some smooth af pick-up lines.
        =" I'm going to need some fire resistance because you're hot."
        = Turns out dragons are golddiggers. Gold check! Do you have enough gold to impress Lirastrasza?
            ( G > 1000 ) !! IF (drunkDragon) then ( G > 750 )
                = One more pick up line and you seal the deal.
                    >"I put on my robe and wizard hat..."
                        = You and Lirastrasa are now going steady.

            ( G < 1000)
                = Too bad, Lirastrasza has a good time on the date and decides to spare the town free of charge.
