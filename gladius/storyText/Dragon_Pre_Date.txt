You return to assets.scenes, with gold in hand and a date with a dragon. Lirastrasza has not agreed to spare the village yet, so you plan your next move.
    > Inform the townspeople of the date. Attempt to set an ambush for Lirastrasza, while you distract her on the date.
        = The townspeople agree that dealing with the dragon would be better than living in fear of it. They will ambush Lirastrasza on the date.
        (ambush)
    > "Nah i'm cool as a cucumber, I'm going on a date with a dragon."
        = You decide to wing it and rely on your sick dragon dating game. Good luck!
